# 🔴 Loop Detection & Per-Iteration Timing Guide

## 🎯 Overview

The system now includes **intelligent loop detection** and **per-iteration performance monitoring** to prevent agents from getting stuck and show exactly where time is spent!

---

## ✅ New Features

### **1. Loop Detection** 🔴

**Detects when agent is stuck repeating the same error:**
- Tracks last 5 errors
- Detects if same error repeats 3 times in a row
- Automatically triggers fallback model
- Provides manual intervention options

### **2. Per-Iteration Timing** ⏱️

**Shows detailed performance metrics for each execution:**
- Total execution time
- LLM call time (included)
- Screenshot time (if enabled, with estimates)
- Tool execution time
- Time savings when screenshots disabled

---

## 🔴 Loop Detection In Action

### **Example: "list index out of range" Loop**

**What Was Happening:**
```
Iteration: 5
🔧: Action: Scroll Tool(label=43...)
🔭: Observation: list index out of range

Iteration: 6
🔧: Action: Scroll Tool(label=43...)
🔭: Observation: list index out of range

Iteration: 7
🔧: Action: Scroll Tool(label=43...)
🔭: Observation: list index out of range

[Agent stuck in infinite loop! ❌]
```

**Now With Loop Detection:**
```
Iteration: 5
🔧: Action: Scroll Tool(label=43...)
🔭: Observation: list index out of range

Iteration: 6
🔧: Action: Scroll Tool(label=43...)
🔭: Observation: list index out of range

Iteration: 7
🔧: Action: Scroll Tool(label=43...)
🔭: Observation: list index out of range

🔴 LOOP DETECTED: Same error repeated 3 times!
   Error pattern: list index out of range
   Agent is stuck in infinite loop!

   🆘 Actions taken:
   - Triggering fallback model automatically
   - Will try alternative approach
   - User can manually intervene if needed

🆘 LOOP DETECTED - Forcing fallback model activation!

   Activating fallback model on next retry...

[Fallback model (Gemini 2.5 Flash) takes over! ✅]

## 🎯 How Loop Detection Works

### **1. Error Tracking**
```python
# System tracks last 5 errors
error_history = [
    "list index out of range",
    "list index out of range",
    "list index out of range"  # ← Same error 3 times!
]
```

### **2. Pattern Detection**
```python
# Check if last 3 errors are identical
if error_history[-1] == error_history[-2] == error_history[-3]:
    LOOP_DETECTED = True
```

### **3. Automatic Response**
```
Loop Detected → Force Fallback Activation → Try Alternative Approach → Manual Intervention if Needed
```

---

## 🆘 What Happens When Loop is Detected

### **Scenario 1: Fallback Model Available**
```
🔴 LOOP DETECTED: Same error repeated 3 times!

🆘 LOOP DETECTED - Forcing fallback model activation!

   Activating fallback model on next retry...

🆘 Step 3/10 - USING FALLBACK MODEL
Primary model failed 3 times, switching to fallback LLM
Fallback Model: google/gemini-2.5-flash-image

[Gemini takes over and tries different approach]
```

### **Scenario 2: Already Using Fallback or No Fallback**
```
🔴 LOOP DETECTED: Same error repeated 3 times!

🆘 LOOP DETECTED - Forcing fallback model activation!

   ⚠️  Already using fallback or no fallback configured
   Asking user for manual intervention...

Agent is stuck. (r)etry, (s)kip, or (a)bort?
```

**Options:**
- **r** = Retry (resets error counter and tries again)
- **s** = Skip this step and continue
- **a** = Abort execution

🔴 LOOP DETECTED: Same error repeated 3 times!
   Error pattern: list index out of range
   Agent is stuck in infinite loop!

   🆘 Actions taken:
   - Triggering fallback model automatically  ← Automatic fix!
   - Will try alternative approach
   - User can manually intervene if needed

🆘 LOOP DETECTED - Forcing fallback model activation!

🆘 Step 3/10 - USING FALLBACK MODEL
Fallback Model: google/gemini-2.5-flash-image

[Gemini tries different approach - no scrolling, uses keyboard]

✅ Step 3 Completed Successfully
   🆘 Fallback model succeeded! Returning to primary model
```

**What Happened:**
1. Primary model stuck scrolling with bad label (3 attempts)
2. Loop detected after 3rd identical error
3. Fallback model automatically activated
4. Gemini uses different approach (keyboard instead of scroll)
5. Success! Returns to primary model

---

## 💡 Why This Matters

### **Before Loop Detection:**
```
❌ Agent repeats same error 50+ times
❌ Wastes time and API calls
❌ Eventually hits max_steps limit
❌ Task fails without intelligent retry
```

### **After Loop Detection:**
```
✅ Detects loop after just 3 repetitions
✅ Automatically switches to fallback model
✅ Tries alternative approach
✅ User can intervene if needed
✅ Task succeeds with intelligent recovery
```

---

## 🎮 How to Use

### **It's Automatic!**

Loop detection and per-iteration timing are **always active** in Mode 5.

No configuration needed - just run:
```bash
python main.py
Select mode: 5
```

```

### **Loop Detected:**
```
🔴 LOOP DETECTED: Same error repeated 3 times!  ← Alert!
   Error pattern: [error message]
   Agent is stuck in infinite loop!

   🆘 Actions taken:                  ← Auto-fix
   - Triggering fallback model
   - Will try alternative approach
```

### **Fallback Activated:**
```
🆘 LOOP DETECTED - Forcing fallback model activation!

🆘 Step X/Y - USING FALLBACK MODEL   ← Switched to Gemini
Fallback Model: google/gemini-2.5-flash-image
```

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### **Loop Detection Sensitivity:**

Currently detects loops after **3 consecutive identical errors**.

To adjust (in `main.py`):
```python
# In AgentMonitor.invoke_with_monitoring()
if len(self.error_history) >= 3:  # ← Change this number
    if self.error_history[-1] == self.error_history[-2] == self.error_history[-3]:
        # Loop detected!
```

**Recommendations:**
- **2 errors** = Very sensitive (may trigger false positives)
- **3 errors** = Balanced (default, recommended)
- **4+ errors** = Less sensitive (wastes more time before detecting)

---

### **Screenshot Impact Estimates:**

The timing breakdown estimates screenshot overhead:
```python
if self.agent.use_vision:
    estimated_screenshot_time = total_time * 0.6  # 60% of time
    estimated_llm_time = total_time * 0.4         # 40% of time
```

These are rough estimates based on typical behavior.

## 🎯 Best Practices

### **1. Monitor for Loops**
Watch for the 🔴 LOOP DETECTED message. It means:
- Agent is stuck
- Same error repeating
- Automatic fallback will activate

### **2. Check Timing Metrics**
If timing is slow:
- Check if screenshots are enabled unnecessarily
- Consider using terminal commands instead of GUI
- Look for repeated operations

### **3. Let Fallback Handle It**
When loop is detected:
- ✅ Let fallback model try automatically
- ✅ Fallback uses different LLM (Gemini)
- ✅ Will try alternative approaches
- ⚠️ Only manually intervene if fallback also fails

### **4. Disable Screenshots for Speed**
If you see:
```
Est. screenshot time: ~10.98s  ← Large overhead!
```

Consider disabling screenshots (set `use_vision=False` in `main.py`)
